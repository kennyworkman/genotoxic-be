# Genotoxic Effects of Base Editors

A presentation for engineers with minimal background in biology to understand
the structure, mechanisms and clinical development of base editing technology.

A selection of methods and data from Fiumara et. al (_Genotoxic effects of base
and prime editing in human hematopoietic stem cells_ [^1]) is covered in depth,
along with a motivation for the experimental design.
